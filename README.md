Created and developed by Laszlo Szeremi (https://www.patreon.com/ShapeshiftingLizard https://ko-fi.com/D1D45NEN)

# Typical applications

* Software asset compression.
* Use as a file archival tool via extensions.
* Application installation.

# Current state

* Only zstd is implemented at this stage.
* Extension field/index compression is unimplemented and untested.
* Lack of further testing.

Future features that are not yet started: True random access for compression methods that can support them, more compression methods, etc.
